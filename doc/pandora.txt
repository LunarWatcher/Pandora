1. Introduction                                             *pandora-introduction*

Pandora is a note-taking helper written in |vim9|. Only limited by your markdown
parser - Pandora doesn't care what system you throw the markdown files into, if
any at all. This plugin is meant to help you write markdown, and specifically
notes, regardless of the how, where, when, and what.

This is largely a meta plugin. It relies on other plugins and programs to do
certain bits of the heavy lifting, but it either goes in a plugin or in my
vimrc, and my vimrc already contains over 1000 lines of code.

While partiually angled towards notes, that isn't the only goal.
The overall goal is to improve the markdown editing experience, in part by
adding extensions for general editing, but also by adding extensions that're
meant to aid with note-taking, regardless of the format.

How?~
 * By following links, enabling links to be a first-class citizen in your
   markdown. This is particularly useful for notes, cheat-sheets, and other bits
   of "decentralized" information
 * Letting you quick-jump to note directories.
 * Add ultisnips snippets for file initialization - typing out frontmatter sucks
 * Overall ehancing markdown editing: Vim has always, in my experience, been
   suboptimal for extensive markdown writing. That changes now.
 * Custom text objects for markdown editing

Requirements~
 * Vim 9-compatible version of Vim. Compatibility currently guaranteed for
   8.2.2717 (may change in the future; may work for versions prior to this
   version). Neovim is not intentionally supported.
 * Plugin with syntax highlighting for markdown ('optional', but recommended)
 * Ultisnips ('optional', required for snippets) 
 * FZF.vim ('optional', required for the markdown list)


================================================================================
2. Options                                                       *pandora-options*

Pandora has a set of options. These are listed here.

Table of Contents:
* |g:PandoraNoteLocations|

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *g:PandoraNoteLocations*

Default: { 'Notes': { 'location': $HOME .. '/.pandora-vim', 'hidden': 0 } }

Defines a set of jump locations.

The map is in the form of: >
    "Some key to display": {
        "location": "Absolute path to your notes",
        "hidden": "whether or not to hide this directory from lists"
    }
<
(note that the above is a visualization of the meaning of the map entries - it's
not an exact syntax representation)

                                                                  *pandora-hidden*
The hidden key in this map refers to whether or not to include the note location
in various lists. It's still possible to |:PandoraJump| to it by name, but
|:PandoraList| will not include the directory.

If 'hidden' is set to 1, the entry will be hidden.

================================================================================
3. UltiSnips                                                   *pandora-ultisnips*

Pandora ships with a set of heavily opinionated frontmatter config. The
opinionated in this context largely refers to what makes sense to include.

The currently bundled snippets are:
 | Snippet abbrev.      | Description                               |
 | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | 
 | hfm                  | "Default" Hugo frontmatter - title and    |
 |                      | date.                                     |

These can be verified by the reader by looking in the UltiSnips directory
bundled with Pandora.
