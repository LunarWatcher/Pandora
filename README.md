# Pandora

Making markdown suck slightly less.

## Warning:

This plugin is still a work in progress. As a part of my general workflow, a few bits of the documentation have been written out ahead of time, and denote features that may not exist yet. If you're adopting this plugin early, please note that broken features may mean it hasn't been implemented yet, regardless of what the documentation says.

## How? Editor enhancements!

A few of Pandora's features include:

* Ultisnips integration to deal with frontmatter - pull requests adding different types of frontmatter are welcome!
* FZF integration for those times you have link-first systems, but didn't want to make a manual list of your documents
* Link following - making links a first-class citizen if that's how you roll with your notes
* Quick jump to note locations
    * ... including the ability to hide certain directories from Pandora's list command 
* Method-agnostic implementation: no matter how or what you're writing, whether that's notes, a code diary, or just documentation, Pandora is built to make the job slightly less shitty
* Tool agnostic: regardless of what you do (or don't) put the markdown in if/when you feel like publishing it, and regardless of what convert it into, Pandora doesn't care.
